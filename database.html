        <h5>What are Databases</h5>
        <p id="subheader">A structured set of data</p>
        <p>Databases are a collection of information,they are used for creating
        ,manipulating,and deleting data.There are many different types of databases
           and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or
          a non-relational database.Relationships means a set of our data is related
        to another section of our data.Meanwhile in a non-relational databases area
      put into sections of data called schemas,inside each schema each data set is
       organized into tables,those tables contain columns and rows to house that
        piticular set of data </p>

          <h4>Storage</h4>
          <img class="data" src="img/harddrive.jpg" alt="harddrive">
          <p>All databases are just a bin of storage.This storage is housed on you
          harddrive,often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just
          database storage(think NSA styled).Our computer stores information on
          harddrive,we are able to create new information,read information,update
          infromation and delete information</p>

          <h4>Searching</h4>
          <img  class="data" src="img/database-search.jpg" alt="search">
          <p>Since there could potentially be al lot of information a database stores
          one problem we might run into is finding hte data we are looking for.Imagine
          we had a room full of books and you were asked to find the coding Dojo algorithm
          Book.Well you might start picking up each book,checking the title and moving
         onto the next until you found it.Thats very slow as most libraries discovered.Instead
         if we were to ID each item we can find it quickly </p>

          <h4>Interaction</h4>
          <img class="data" src="img/dbinteraction.png" alt="interaction">
          <p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that
          holds onto all saved data.Well if only one user had access to that data is just
          like what we have built into our own computers,it wouldnt be useful to other
          users.However the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin many users
          can interact with,creating,reading,updating and deleting information that all users
          would use. </p>

          <h4>Companies</h4>
          <img class="data"src="img/database-search.jpg" alt="search">
          <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of
            information.As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of
            companies on the market.That being said a lot of thier software is free for
            most users,think of MySQL,which while being an incredible DB is completely free
            of cost and is used by a large company called Facebook </p>

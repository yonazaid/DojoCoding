        <p class="header">What is Git</p>
        <p class="theses">Git is a version contro sytem; you can think of
         it as a series of snapshots(commits) of your
        code base.with the creation of each snapshot you built out a whole
         a whole application,seeing the growth of a full app.
        During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back
        and come back to previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the
        the your app.</p>
        <p class="header">What is GitHub</p>
        <p class="theses">GiHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
        It lets you and others work together on projects form anywhere using those
        code snapshots that you toook during development. </p>

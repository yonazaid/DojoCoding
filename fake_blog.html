  <div id="lorem">

    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It <span>has survived not only five centuries</span>, but also the
      leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
      like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <h1> Where does it come from? </h1>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
     roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
     2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
     College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, cons
     ectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
     word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
     Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
     Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
     book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Rena
     issance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
     comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
